# Design Patterns - Builder

This repository showcases an implementation of the Builder design pattern in C#. The code demonstrates how to create complex objects step-by-step, enabling different representations of the object to be built using the same construction process. This pattern is useful for creating objects that need to be constructed in a specific sequence and when different variations of an object need to be supported.

## Introduction
The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is particularly helpful when an object needs to be built with various configurations or components in a controlled manner.

## Implementation Overview
This repository provides a C# implementation of the Builder design pattern for constructing `House` objects. Key components of the code include:

- **HouseBuilder**: The abstract base class defining the construction steps for a house.
- **StandardHouseBuilder** and **LuxuryHouseBuilder**: Concrete implementations that specify the details for building standard and luxury houses, respectively.
- **House**: The product class representing the complex object being built.
- **HouseDirector**: The director class that orchestrates the construction process.
- **Program**: Demonstrates how to use the builder pattern to construct both standard and luxury houses.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DesignPatterns-Builder.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DesignPatterns-Builder
```

Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# development environment to explore the implementation.

## Usage
1. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in your C# development environment.
2. Run the `Program` class to see the Builder pattern in action.
3. Modify the builder or director classes to customize the construction process as needed.
